**Alt text:** A HTML attribute used in HTML documents to specify alternative text that is to be displayed when the element to which it is applied cannot be rendered.  Alt text is also used by "screen reader" software so that a person who is listening to the content of a webpage (for instance, a person who is blind) can interact with this element. Every image should have an alt attribute to be accessible, but it need not contain text. A good way to explain context or identify what the image is for example.

**App:** An applocation that either runs on a mobile device or in a web page

**Backup:** A copy of a website, project, data of some kind to be stored in at least two different locations for safety, so in the case something happens to the website,project, or data one can recover quickly from the loss.

**Creative Commons:** One of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted "work". A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they (the author) have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of a given work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/

**DNS:** Domain Name System, the "glue" that keeps the Internet working.  DNS maps domain names (like www.sca.org) to numerical IP addresses (like `192.237.180.41`), so that any kind of request (mail, web, etc.) are routed to the correct server responsible for the domain.

For instance, modification, redistribution by third parties, and reverse engineering are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others.

**Markup (Language):**  Markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors), which is traditionally written with a red pen or blue pencil on authors' manuscripts. Such "markup" typically includes both content corrections (such as spelling, punctuation, or movement of content), and also typographic instructions, such as to make a heading larger or boldface.

**MIT License:** A popular Open Source license which states that anyone may use, modify, and distribute a piece of software.

**Strong Password:** A strong password is something that is not easily guessed and is _never_ shared among active users.  Aim for something randomly generated and stored via a password manager tool (such as 1Password or LastPass) which often exceeds minimum suggested values for password length, complexity, etc.  If you do not use a password manager, recommended password lengths are 8 to 64 characters (or more, if possible), with longer always being better.  Checking https://haveibeenpwned.com/ regularly is a good idea (1Password does this automatically for you, should you choose to use it).
