## Techsoup

Techsoup is a verification service and marketplace for Nonprofit organizations. Techsoup has also partnered with 70 other organizations to provide similar services around the globe. Techsoup and its partner organizations will hereafter be referred to collectively as Techsoup. Once your nonprofit status is verified you will have access to a variety of products and services that are free or significantly discounted. Other organizations - Google, for example - use Techsoup to verify your nonprofit status for access to additional services that they make available for nonprofits. To access these products and services you must first complete the registration and verification process. 

Signing up for Techsoup requires setting up a new account. Information that you will need to set up your account includes the following. This list is subject to change. 

* __Community Nickname__: This is the name that your organization will be assigned within Techsoup. This name should be unique and descriptive, for example: Society for Creative Anachronism, Kingdom of Atlantia. A good general practice is to use the same name as the legal name under which your group is incorporated. 
* __Email Address__: It is recommended that this account be attached to the Kingdom Webminister's email so that future KWeb Officers have access to the account for managment.
* __Incorporation ID__: *Important: This is where most groups experience the most trouble.* You must use the nonprofit legal identifier (Tax EIN in the United States) number for YOUR GROUP, NOT FOR SCA CORPORATE. Contact your Kingdom Seneschal and/or Exchequer for this information.  

Once you complete the sign up form there will be a review period for Techsoup to evaluate your request. During this time you can log in to the website and browse the available discounts and services. Once your nonprofit status is verified you will receive an email notification that you are authorized to request products and services. 

## WordPress

WordPress is both available to host yourself or as a cloud service available from wordpress.com and many other providers.

If self-hosted, PHP Versions should be kept up to date as Wordpress is built on PHP
- Make sure the theme/plugins/WP version you are using is compatible with the version of PHP you are on

Selected themes & plugins should be updated for new versions of WP on a regular basis.
- Themes & plugins that have not been tested with the current and last version of WP should be replaced.
- Plugins & themes should be checked for compatibility for new major versions of WP before updating

Disable the ability for people to create accounts as this can lead to security risks.

Try to ensure themes used are mobile friendly.

Don't use pirated, cracked, or otherwise comprimised plugins/themes. Download plugins/themes from official sources.

Autoupdates should be handled with care. Generally it is ok to autoupdate plugins/themes and WP versions, but take care to make sure those updates are not adding unwanted features or are poorly coded. There have been instances where a plugin with a large user base was purchased by another company and then its functionality completely changed, or were more poorly coded than the original. Autoupdating can help prevent secrity issues.

Anyone who is responsible for a WP instance should subscribe to plugin author's pages to keep up to date with version updates.

## Let's Encrypt
It is widely considered modern best practice to provide all online services over encrypted protocols, such as HTTPS.  All of the major web browsers these days are defaulting to https:// URLs if the protocol is not specified, and many even attempt to "upgrade" to HTTPS when HTTP was specified explicitly.  At some time in the future it is expected that the HTTP protocol (without S) will be completely turned off by the browsers, although as of this writing we do not have any idea when that will occur.  Also, even sites that provide information of seemingly insignificant importance, such as nearly all of those we create for the SCA, do still have exposure that makes encrpytion valuable: logins for updating the content of the site.  Spammers and hackers don't care that our sites are of limited audience, defacing a site is defacing a site for whomever is paying their fees.

With the overall goal of making the Internet more secure, the Let's Encrypt Certificate Authority provides encryption certificates completely free of charge, and renewal of those certificates can be completely automated.  This has eliminated all of the roadblocks to running a secure website from days past.  Many hosting providers support Let's Encrypt natively for all sites, as do all of the major administrative dashboards (cPanel, Webmin, etc).  For situations where the servers are under our control, the "certbot" client can be installed from nearly every major OS repository and can install certificates automatically for all major web servers.  https://letsencrypt.org/ if you're interested in more reading.

# Cloud Services

## Google for Nonprofits

How to organise your Google setup. 

## Google Forms & Automation

Automating processes using forms, Google Sheets and javascript

Google Forms can be used to collect data, such as officer reports, auth forms or marshal information, or award recommendations. It also can be used to collect information for general surveys.

Information submitted to a Google Form is automatically aggregated upon submission. If desired, information can also automatically be sent to a linked Google Sheet. This data can be stored or downloaded. If the user adds Google Extensions or Add-Ons to Google Forms, or knows how to script, they can further manipulate the information in a way that can be useful the the user.

Additionally, if a user knows how to use Google Data Studio (GDS), the Google Sheet information can be manipulated and used in GDS reports, either publicly or privately with direct report sharing.

## Google Drive

Google Drive is a cloud-based filesystem, which can be free on the lowest tier of Google for Nonprofits (GFNP) or through creating an officer or Branch account, if allowed by your Kingdom and/or Local Branch laws & policies.

Google Drive allows for document storage of various types of files, including (but not limited to) word-processing, spreadsheets, slide presentations, PDFs, and audio-visual files.

Files in Google Drive can have sharing of files with other specifically named individuals or the public, either in a view-only mode or an edit mode. If you are part of GFNP, you also have these modes available at an organizational level.

Lastly, as a GFNP account, you will have access to Shared Drives, which are Cloud Drives for your organization. Unlike the files in Drive belonging to a specific individual, files in the Shared Drives belong to the organization and have no specific named creator/owner. Shared Drives can be created for different officers positions and their deputies or committees, for Local Groups, for Guilds, for Orders, and so on. Each Shared Drive will have a Manager, and then will have invited Editors, Contributors, or Viewers. 

* Drive can easily be used to off-load files from your webserver, such as MP4s and PDFs, and link to or embed them into websites.

* Folders set to "Anyone on the Internet can access" in "Viewer" mode are an excellent way to publicly share a directory of files.

Google Drive and Shared Drives can be accessed on multiple types of devices, including computers and mobile devices.

## OneDrive

Microsoft OneDrive a cloud-based filesystem. It allows for document storage of various types of files, including (but not limited to) word-processing, spreadsheets, slide presentations, PDFs, and audio-visual files.

Files in OneDrive can be shared with other specifically-named individuals or the public, either in a view-only mode or an edit mode. 

Lastly, you will have access to SharePoint, which is a Cloud Drive for your organization. SharePoint Folders can be created for different officers positions and their deputies or committees, for Local Groups, for Guilds, for Orders, and so on. Each Shared Drive will have a Manager, and then will have invited Editors, Contributors, or Viewers. 

OneDrive can be accessed on multiple types of devices, including computers and mobile devices.

## GitHub / GitLab 

GitHub and GitLab are popular source code repositories, allowing multiple contributors to collaborate on code (and documentation) that may be used in Kingdom or local websites and services.
