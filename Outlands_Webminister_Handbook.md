### 3.2 Accounts and Services

## Financial Activities
Because the cost of domains and web hosting can be high, it is recommended that caution be
exercised before using SCA funds to support your web site. The Kingdom will provide web-
hosting space for free to groups which can not maintain their own website and for a minimal
charge for groups which do maintain their own website. It is highly recommended that all groups
take advantage of this service, as it will save the Kingdom money, and provide a greater service
to its populace.

No matter how the site is funded, all pages must meet the financial requirements listed here.
Advertising is strictly forbidden, this includes banner ads from such sites as Geocities. Geocities
and the like are strictly prohibited from being used as hosting services. If your web pages are paid
for with SCA funds, you must turn in financial reports and expense reports to your local
Exchequer, and the Kingdom Webminister. The form of this reporting is left up to the discretion of
the Exchequer. If you use SCA funds to purchase software or equipment, this property belongs to
the SCA. Copies of SCA purchased software may not be kept for personal use after the
Webminister steps down.

### 3.3 Office Web Presence
The kingdom shall provide hosting, domain registration, and email.
