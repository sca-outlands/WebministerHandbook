# Reporting and Warranting

## Reporting Requirements

Quarterly reports are due to the Society Webminister by the following dates:
March 1st, June 1st, September 1st, and December 1st.

The first quarterly report of the year, due on March 1, is the Annual Report or Domesday report.  This shall include:

1. Complete contact information for the Webminister and all direct deputies, to include membership number, membership expiration date and warrant expiration date,
2. A roster of all warranted webministers,
3. Summary of the status of the office within the Kingdom, as well as any financial expenditures (hosting, server maintenance, firewalls, email accounts, software, etc.), and
4. Recommendations/commendations for the Master William Blackfox Web Awards 

Each quarterly report shall include:

1. Issues being addressed, 
2. Pages created, updated, and removed,
3. Kingdom websites created or removed, 
4. Policies implemented, 
5. Questions the Kingdom Webminister may have, and 
6. Any other pertinent data deemed appropriate in communications from the Society Webminister.


## Communication with the Society Webminister

Communication is key to the Webminister Office. The Society Webminister is available to give advice and assist in problem solving. Questions regarding policy issues and/or interpretations, Kingdom problems related to the webministry, copyright issues, or other larger matters or concerns shall be brought to the attention of the Society Webminister.



## Transfer of Office

Generally speaking, the Society Webminister will approve the successor chosen by the current Kingdom Webminister and Crown. The current Kingdom Webminister shall be sure the proposed successor reads the Society Webminister Handbook and any Kingdom Webminister policies before accepting a nomination.


### Notification

It is the responsibility of the outgoing Kingdom officer to send a letter to the Society Webminister with notification that a new Kingdom Webminister has been nominated. The letter must include:

1. The proposed new Webminister's modern name, address, phone number, and e-mail address,
2. A review of the proposed Webminister's qualifications,
3. The planned date the office will change hands, and
4. The signed warrant for the new Webminister. 

If the Kingdom's Webminister office has been elevated to the status of Greater Office, please include an extra copy of the warrant paperwork for the Society Webminister to sign and return, in addition to the copy kept for records. 

Copies of this letter must be sent to the proposed new Webminister, the Crown, and the Kingdom Seneschal. 

The new Webminister shall follow this letter with an introductory letter. Should the warrant be approved, the new Webminister should shall this letter with an introductory letter to the corporate office, the Kingdom Ombudsman, and the Webminister’s Ombudsman.


### Transfer of Records

All records, equipment, funds, and other materials belonging to the Webminister’s office will be transferred within 30 days of the change of office. This includes the timely turnover of all passwords, server names, and other administrative access. Changes to WHOIS Registrations and all accounts that must be in the Webminister's name must be changed within 30 days.


## Oversight of Local Websites

The supervision of local Webministers within the Society falls to the office of the Kingdom Webminister in each kingdom. It is important that locally produced websites present the SCA as a positive experience, both to the members of the local branches they represent and to any new or prospective members who read them.

Each Kingdom must have a method of supervising its local Webministers. The Kingdom Webminister is responsible for ensuring that all local Webministers are aware of and abide by the copyright laws of the country/countries in which the Kingdom is located, by the Laws and Customs of their Kingdom, and by the policies in the Webminister Handbook.

## Warranting

Warrants are official recognition of the legal agency and standing of an officer within the corporate SCA structure. Kingdom Webministers are officers and therefore require warrants. Warrant forms can be found in Appendix B of the Governing Documents of the Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc. (Corpora), and on the SCA’s website. 

The Society Webminister is warranted by the BoD (Board of Directors) in consultation with the Manager of IT and reports to the Manager of IT on a quarterly basis.  Kingdom Webministers are warranted by their Kingdom Crown and Seneschal,  in consultation with the Society Webminister, and report to the Society Webminister on a quarterly basis.  

### Re-warranting

The Kingdom Webminister may not be re-warranted without the approval of the Society Webminister. 
Causes for which a warrant may not be renewed include, but are not limited to:

- Use of the website to promote factionalism within a Kingdom
- Proven inability to answer correspondence, either from the corporate level or from within the Kingdom
- Politicizing the office of Kingdom Webminister
- Failure to respect and adhere to the ideals of the Society

## Removal from Office

### Causes

Kingdom Webministers are subject to removal from office as stipulated in Corpora. The causes for which the Society Webminister may seek the removal of a Kingdom Webminister include, but are not limited to:

- Use of objectionable material
- Use of copyrighted material without permission
- Failure to maintain a Society membership as outlined in the governing documents of the Society
- Failure to faithfully execute the duties of the office of Webminister
- Extended, persistent lack of communication 
- Failure to abide by the policies in this document


### Suspension or Removal at Kingdom Request

Should a Kingdom request the removal of the Kingdom Webminister for causes not readily apparent to the Society Webminister, the Society Webminister will investigate the circumstances of the request. Should the evidence show that the Kingdom’s request is valid, even if the corporate office has no reason to remove the officer, the Society Webminister may agree to the removal. The Crown has the option of suspending the Webminister at any time for just and stated cause, as provided in Corpora, for the duration of the current reign. In the case of a suspension, the Webminister’s deputy will assume the office for the remainder of the reign.
