# Responsibilities

## Official Websites

The primary responsibility of the Webministry, as laid forth in the Society's Governing Documents, is overseeing the official websites of the Kingdoms, local branches, and other groups within each Kingdom, collectively known as "official websites."  Every Kingdom must publish a website and each local branch, guild, or other group within each Kingdom is encouraged to have one as well.

### Website Content

When it comes content Webministers primary role is facilitating, either by uploading content provided or by enabling others to manage content directly. Webministers execute oversight over content to ensure it complies with local standards and regulations. 

The content managed by the Webminister for an SCA website typically consists of three types:

* Content originating from the various offices in the branch for which the relevant officer is responsible. Examples of this would be a local marshal handbook or guidelines from the seneschal on reporting. Webministers and their team should exercise caution when managing this content as it is not their responsibility.
* Content organization: These would be pieces of content connecting different pieces of the website together. For instance a short text introducing potential participants to the activities in the society and directing them to the relevant officer pages or information on the current royals. Webministers and their team often pick up items in this category. Activity here is commendable but not required. 
* Overall look and feel: The structural pieces of the website(s), standards for the look and feel of the website with the intent to create a coherent experience for visitors. This could include graphics or translations of word documents to a html documents. This is the bread and butter work of Webministers and the core of their responsibility.

Webministers are primarily responsible for:

- The website infrastructure
- Facilitating others to post content online: It is encouraged to solicit content, but Webministers are not responsible for finding content.
- Ensure security is maintained
- Ensure policy compliance on websites within their purview

Webministers may, at their discretion:

- Create content
- Actively maintain calendars, etc.

## Other Internet Infrastructure

In some Kingdoms, Webministers are also responsible for other types of Internet infrastructure, such as email services or cloud-based applications. 

Kingdom IT infrastructure can include:

* Email accounts
* Mailing lists
* Web forums
* Office productivity software provided by the Kingdom, such as Google Workspace or Microsoft Office 365
* Internet-hosted database applications
* Wikis

## Organizational

### Kingdom Webministers
* Annual submissions to the Society Webminister for the Master William Blackfox Web Awards
* Issue, and manage, warrants to Webministers within the Kingdom (See Reporting & Warranting Chapter)
* Oversee "helpdesk" and ensure timely responses to issues

### All Webministers
* Supervise deputies
* Regularly report up the chain of command
* Keep within budget as allotted

## Limits of Responsibility

Online services and activities that are expressly assigned to offices outside of the Webministry, such as Social Media, are outside of the responsibility of the Webministry and the Webministry can not be held responsible for them.  Individuals who choose to hold multiple positions do so by their own choice.

## Online Privacy and Data Policies

All Webministers shall be aware of the SCA's Privacy Policy and adhere to its requirements, as it applies to all SCA websites and online services.

For examples of how to implement these principles, see the Society Webminister's Resources Guide.

Kingdoms may optionally implement their own data policies. If the Kingdom does not have a data policy the Kingdom Webminister shall have a data policy for the data they control (e.g. databases or emails for which the office is responsible). 

## Release Forms for Personal Information, Photographs, and Other Creative Works

All Webministers shall be aware of the SCAâ€™s policies laid out in the Release Forms Handbook and adhere to its requirements. Obtain written consent from individuals before publishing their personal data or portrait-style images depicting them. Ensure you have a license or grant of use before publishing photographs, videos, or creative works.

## Avoid Taking Sides in Disputes

Webministers shall ensure their website benefits the entirety of their Kingdom or the community they serve.

Official websites shall not take sides in disputes within the SCA. Official websites must not publish personal attacks, or seek to advance the aims of particular factions within a kingdom or branch.

Philosophical discussions of the way the Society or a Local Branch operates are not out of place, but shall be handled carefully. Articles that cause anger and divert people from historical study and re-creation shall be avoided.

Use of official websites to further personal or factional agendas is grounds for removal from office.
