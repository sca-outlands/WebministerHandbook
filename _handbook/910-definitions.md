# Appendix 1: Common Terms and Definitions

**2FA:** 2 Factor Authentication. Electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something only the user knows like a password), possession (something only the user has like a token code), and inherence (something only the user is usually using biometric checks).

**App:** An application that either runs on a mobile device or in a web page

**Backup:** A copy of a website, project, data of some kind to be stored in at least two different locations for safety, so in the case something happens to the website, project, or data one can recover quickly from the loss.  Backups can be done manually or automated, but need to be validated regularly.  Trust but verify.

**CMS:** Content Management System (such as like WordPress) that once installed can allow users, even with limited skills, to manage websites.  Generally provides a WYSIWYG editor for simple editing of page content.  It also allows for more dynamic content and automation.

**Copyright:** The rights one has over the use and duplication of a creative work (like photos, videos or text).

**Creative Commons:** One of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted "work". A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they (the author) have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of a given work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/

**DNS:** Domain Name System, the "glue" that keeps the Internet working.  DNS maps domain names (like www.sca.org) to numerical IP addresses (like `192.237.180.41`), so that any kind of request (mail, web, etc.) are routed to the correct server responsible for the domain.

**Domain:** The internet address in its top-level form (i.e. yahoo.com, sca.org, google.com).

**Embed:** Having media like videos or music, possibly from a different location, inserted in to your web page.

**Group Pages:** Websites or pages for a specific branch, office, guild, etc.

**Guild:** A group of people within the SCA officially chartered by the Kingdom or a local group for a specific purpose, usually the promotion of a particular Art or Science.

**Hosting:** The server or company that is maintaining the server on which web pages are stored.

**Household:** A group of people within the SCA not recognized as an official SCA branch.

**HTML:** Hypertext Markup Language: HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

**Markup (Language):**  Markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors), which is traditionally written with a red pen or blue pencil on authors' manuscripts. Such "markup" typically includes both content corrections (such as spelling, punctuation, or movement of content), and also typographic instructions, such as to make a heading larger or boldface.

**Nameserver:** Dedicated server/s that manage DNS for domains.  These are either the local server that machines use to find domains, and or is the servers responsible for a specific domain.

**Officer Pages:** Websites or pages for an office or officer in a Kingdom or local group

**Official Site/Page:** A website recognized as the website for that group or office, which is recognized by the group

**Permissions:** Security levels used on web servers or other services to manage access to various functions of the service and/or files and folders. 

**Releases:** Forms, depending on circumstance, to allow the grant of use of artwork, the photograph or video of individuals or small groups, software/code, or giving permission as a/the subject having been photographed/videoed.

**Responsive:** A web page layout that adapts to the size of the browser screen or window. Responsive websites can help users have good experiences whether they are on mobile devices or larger laptop or desktop screens.

**Server:** A physical or virtual machine that manages security, data, and/or services.  Examples include web servers delivering web pages, and media servers will deliver images, music, or videos.

**Social Media:** Websites, applications and platforms where users create and share content with each other.

**Strong Password:** A strong password is something that is not easily guessed and is _never_ shared among active users.  Aim for something randomly generated and stored via a password manager tool (such as 1Password or LastPass) which often exceeds minimum suggested values for password length, complexity, etc.  If you do not use a password manager, recommended password lengths are 8 to 64 characters (or more, if possible), with longer always being better.  Checking https://haveibeenpwned.com/ regularly is a good idea (1Password does this automatically for you, should you choose to use it).

**Subdomain:** Example of subdomains would be members.sca.org or heraldry.sca.org (both being subdomains of sca.org)

**Website or Site:** An grouping of pages hosted by a single entity or a collection of web pages gathered together to represent an idea or theme.

**Webminister:** The greater officer in charge of a group's (Kingdom, Principality, Barony, Shire, etc.) digital assets, like webpages and email. 

**Webministry:** Overarching term for all of the people and services under the purview of a Webminister.

**WHOIS:** A query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or other information.

**WYSIWYG:** What You See Is What You Get; a concept where content is edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation.
