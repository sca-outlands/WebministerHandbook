# Website Construction


## Official Websites, definition

Official websites are recognized by the local Kingdom Webminister and include websites for local groups and organizations within the Kingdom. Official websites need to adhere to the same regulations as kingdom websites. In addition to the Kingdom and local branch websites, Kingdom Webministers may designate additional websites that are associated with Kingdom Offices, Royal Guilds, or other groups within the Society as official websites. 

For a website to be an official website of the Society for Creative Anachronism, it must represent a recognized branch, office, guild, etc. of the Society or provide an official service via the web to such a group, and must have a warranted Webminister responsible for its content. The Society for Creative Anachronism will not recognize websites for households, individuals, informal guilds, or unofficial military units. Kingdom or branch officers with separate or additional Internet sites for that office are responsible for ensuring that all such sites comply with Society guidelines.

Websites which are not run by the Webministry, such as those operated by individuals, households, businesses, or other groups which may be adjacent to the Society but are not managed by it are not and can not be considered official websites. Avoid ambiguity as to whether or not websites are official: while there are no hard-an-fast rules, factors that could lead people to believe an unofficial website is official include using the name of a specific SCA branch in its titles or URLs, having the website be maintained by SCA officers, or routinely linking to it as part of official communications.  If an unofficial website seems likely to create confusion about whether it is official, this creates a risk of unintended consequences for the SCA including reputational damage, trademark dilution, or legal liability.  Webministers must promptly bring such situations to the attention of relevant officers in both the webministry and the seneschalate.

## All Official Websites

All official websites must include:

* A copyright statement.
* A disclaimer listing who is responsible for the site, including an email address, which is usually Webminister@ and website's domain name. 

All Kingdom and Local Branch websites shall include:

* A description of the branch's geographic scope, including modern boundaries.
* Kingdom websites shall include links to the websites of their local branches; local branch, office, guild, or inter-Kingdom event websites shall include links to the website of their Kingdom(s).
* A list of the branch's officers and royals (if applicable).
* A current calendar of upcoming events.
* Links to current governing documents, such as Kingdom laws or Branch charters.
* Information for both newcomers and established members, given that these two groups need different information.

Each Kingdom's website shall be a showpiece of that Kingdom, showing it in the finest possible light. Websites will uphold high standards of excellence in order to demonstrate the pride that each Kingdom has in itself, and provide the best possible reflection of the Society.

## Accessibility Guidelines

Care shall be taken to make websites accessible on multiple browsers and platforms, including mobile devices, and to make sites accessible to those users with disabilities.  Those wishing more guidance on website accessibility should refer to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Accessibility Standards Overview and are encouraged to leverage a site checker.

## Referencing Society Policies

When referencing Society policies and other official documents, link to the relevant page on [sca.org](https://www.sca.org/) or another appropriate website, rather than downloading a copy of the document and re-posting elsewhere. This ensures that viewers are seeing the most recent version rather than an out-of-date copy. (Link the page rather than the specific document, in case of changes.)

## Personal Information, Photographs, and Creative Works

As outlined in the Release Forms Handbook, Webministers may need written permission before publishing personal information, creative works, or images of individuals, whether to a official website or third-party hosting service:

* Personal information shall not be displayed on official websites unless the Webminister has the appropriate release form on file. 
* Photographs, videos, artworks, and creative writing shall not be published unless the Webminister has a release on file from the creator. 
* Photographs, videos, and artworks that depict individuals in a "portrait style" shall not be published unless the Webminister has a release on file from the person or people pictured.
