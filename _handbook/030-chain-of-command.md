# Chain of Command

The purpose of a Chain of Command is to show who is responsible for what job and to identify who reports to whom in the organization. While we are an organization of volunteers, it is still vital to understand  lines of communication within the organization. 

## Office Hierarchy

Society Webminister and Kingdom Webministers provide guidance to local branches as requested or needed to ensure (Kingdom) policies are upheld. 

The Society Webminister is responsible for:

* Establishing and maintaining society-wide standards for websites and Internet technology.
* Warranting Kingdom Webministers.
* Collecting reports from Kingdom Webministers.
* Reporting to the Board on the overall state of the webministry.

Kingdom Webministers are responsible for:

* Maintaining their Kingdom's website.
* Warranting and overseeing local Webministers in their Kingdom.
* Maintaining a roster of local branch Webministers who report to them.
* Collecting reports from local Webministers.
* Reporting to the Society Webminister on the overall state of webministry activity in their Kingdom. 
* Setting Kingdom policies which supplement (but do not supersede) society policies. 

Local Webministers are responsible for:

* Maintaining the website for which they are warranted.
* Reporting to their Kingdom Webminister.

Webministers at all levels of the chain of command may have deputies to assist them in their work.

The Webministers of the Pennsic War and Gulf War websites are to be considered a Deputies to the
Society Webminister in all ways, including reporting for the duration of the site's existence and
are bound to the same requirements listed in the Officer Requirements chapter. The War Webministers need not be warranted as they are considered Deputies.
