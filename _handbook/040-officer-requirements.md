# Officer Requirements

In order to ensure the Webministry properly fulfils its responsibilities, all Webministers must meet certain requirements.

## Requirements for All Webministers

* All Webministers must meet the membership requirements of the office as outlined in Corpora. If a Webminister's membership lapses during the term of office that officerâ€™s warrant is considered terminated immediately upon expiration. 
* Reliable Internet Access
* Experience using HTML and/or CMS, as applicable

## Kingdom Webministers

- Experience with ISPs and hosting services
- Experience with mail servers, if applicable
- Organization, coordination, delegation
- Fundamentals of project management
- Be able to communicate requirements and realities of technology with non-technical people
- Have a good understanding of how technology works, changes, and evolves, and an understanding of how to troubleshoot issues when they arise.

Kingdom Webministers can appoint deputies as they need and see fit to accomplish the mission/project.

## Branch Webministers

Depending on Kingdom requirements and where the Branch website is hosted, requirements for Branch Webministers may vary. 

For example, some Branches may need to have experience with ISPs, hosting services, and/or mail servers, and others may be hosted on their Kingdom's server and, therefore, not items needed to be known by the Branch Webminister.

The following are guidelines for Branch Webministers:

- Be a warranted Webminister
- Read, understand, and follow the Kingdom Webminister Policies
- Organization, coordination, delegation
- Fundamentals of project management
- Be able to communicate about technology items with non-technical people
- Have a good understanding of how technology works, changes, and evolves, and an understanding of how to troubleshoot issues when they arise.
