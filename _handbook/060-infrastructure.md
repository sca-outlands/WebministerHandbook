# 6 Infrastructure
## 6.1 Hosting Requirements
The kingdom shall maintain service provider(s) capable of supporting the technology needs of the kingdom, officer web properties, and branches. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Hosting for official web properties
* Domain registration
* Communications services (e.g. email)
* Electronic document archiving

It is strongly recommended that branch web ministers use kingdom services. Branch web ministers must ask for and receive approval from the Kingdom Web Minister before hosting official websites outside the kingdom-provided services.

## 6.2 Domain Names
### Branch Web Properties
All branches will be provided with a domain which follows the format **[branchname].outlands.org**. A branch may additionally petition to add a single domain following the format **[branchname].org**, which will be registered and paid for by the kingdom. Other legacy domains may be continued at the discretion of the Kingdom Web Minister. Any additional domains must be registered and paid for by the branch, not an individual.

### Other Web Properties
All kingdom web properties shall be provided with a domain which follows the format **[entity].outlands.org**. Official web properties may petition to maintain an additional domain name, which must be registered to the Office of Web Ministry.

## 6.3 Kingdom Accounts
All official accounts and services shall be registered to a recognized kindgom user, not an individual, unless that is impossible. The kingdom Seneschal and the kingdom Webwright, as well as appropriate appointed deputies, shall have access to all official accounts and services. If any account incurs a financial requirement, the kingdom Exchequer and any appropriate deputy shall also have access.
