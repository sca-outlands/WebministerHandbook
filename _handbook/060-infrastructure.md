# Infrastructure

## Hosting Requirements

At a minimum, SCA Kingdoms are mandated to have an official website.  Kingdoms may also officially provide email, mailing lists, wikis, and other online services at the discretion of the Kingdom Webminister, so long as those services are not otherwise assigned to other Offices such as social media.

All official services must be hosted on platforms that are: secure, reliable, actively maintained, has an active community or paid support channel, is field-proven, and is well-regarded in the industry.  This includes that all services shall, to the maximum extent possible, be provided over encrypted channels such as HTTPS, not HTTP.

All official services must have multiple people with administrative access, to ensure that services can be actively maintained in the event that a single administrator might become unavailable.  Administrative access for all official services, including local branch websites, must be also be held by the Kingdom Webministry for continuity purposes.

Official services may never be hosted on a service that requires banner or popup advertisements, or third-party advertisements beyond a potential link back in the footer. 

All payments for Webministry services shall be made according to SCA, Kingdom, and Branch (as applicable) Financial Policies.

## Domain Names

Official domain names will be purchased and registered by the Kingdom in such a way that the ownership shall remain with the Kingdom through changes of officers.  Kingdoms that wish to use a domain underneath the "sca.org" umbrella will be provided such a domain at no cost to the kingdom.

Official websites are encouraged to use the same domain name as the kingdom or their associated local office, but may use different domain names with the approval of the Kingdom Webminister provided that they are registered as owned by the branch and not the individuals involved.
